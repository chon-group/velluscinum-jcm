## Stamp Transaction definition
_"Stamping a transaction is a self-transfer and unification process. Self-transfer, therefore, the units received from a divisible asset are transferred to itself, spending the received transaction (filling the OUTPUT pointer with the address of its wallet). Unification because this process joins the units from the received transaction with those already in the wallet. A transaction with two or more INPUT pointers and a single OUTPUT pointer is generated in this process"_.
